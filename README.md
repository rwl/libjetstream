# Jetstream C/C++ interface

The `libjetstream` crate provides an interface for using [Jetstream](https://github.com/rwl/jetstream) from C/C++.
It is based in the `c-interface` from [Slipstream](https://github.com/synaptecltd/slipstream/tree/main/c-interface).

## Example

The `example` directory contains an example C++ program that uses Jetstream. This approach could also be used with 
Python, Java, and some other languages.

To test the interface run:

```
make -C example all check
```

The example involves the following files:

- `lib.rs` is a wrapper file for accessing the Jetstream API from C. It deals with use of `structs` and other
  types in the Jetstream API which are not directly compatible with the C interface. It maintains a list of
  active `Enocder` and `Decoder` objects, so that the C code does not need to keep track of these. The C code accesses
  and interacts with these objects by passing UUIDs. This approach is basic, and it is up to the caller to ensure that
  duplicate UUIDs are not provided.
- `main.cpp` provides an example of how to use Jetstream from C/C++, for both encoding and decoding. In particular, it
  shows how to format arguments and return values for the API functions. The example includes two separate tests: 1)
  batch encoding of an entire message, and 2) iterative sample-by-sample encoding. Batch encoding is more efficient due
  to fewer function calls, but it is only possible if all data samples are available. The iterative approach might be
  suitable for streaming of data in real-time. Note that most of the code in this file is for managing and monitoring
  tests, and the main parts of interest are the `jetstream_*` function calls.
- `jetstream.h` is generated by the `cargo build` command and defines the C/C++ API.
- `target/release/libcjetstream.so` is the object file generated by `cargo build --profile release`.

Note that C++ is used in the example only for accurate timing using `std::chrono`, but the approach should be suitable
for integrating with C and C++ code. The build script could use `gcc` instead of `g++` for pure C code.

## Example code output

After running `make all check`, the output similar to the following should be printed to the shell:

```bash
using Rust lib from C/C++

*** 1. perform encoding of all samples ***

samples encoded: 4000, length: 46474 bytes

*** 2. perform iterative encoding of samples ***
